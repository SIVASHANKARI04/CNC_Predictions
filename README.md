**CNC Machine Failure Prediction**

Eternal URL:http://3.110.43.170:8501

This repository contains a complete end-to-end project for predicting CNC machine failures.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, skewness & kurtosis analysis, machine learning model development, and deployment on an AWS instance using PuTTY.

CNC machines are crucial in modern manufacturing, and unexpected machine failures can lead to costly downtimes.
This project aims to predict potential CNC machine failures by:

**Cleaning and preparing data:** Removing inconsistencies and handling missing values.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and relationships among features.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Validating assumptions about the data.

**Statistical Analysis:** Evaluating skewness and kurtosis to understand data distribution.

**Machine Learning:** Building and testing predictive models.

**Deployment:** Hosting the predictive service on an AWS instance using PuTTY for remote management.
